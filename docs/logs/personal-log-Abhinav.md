### 2. Recap of Weekly Goals

This week focused on beginning Milestone 3 frontend implementation with a low-risk dashboard shell that teammates can build on.  
My contributions included:
- implementing a frontend dashboard mode toggle (`Private` / `Public`) in the Electron + React renderer
- adding a local search and category filter bar for dashboard sections
- creating placeholder portfolio/resume/timeline/heatmap/showcase cards to structure Milestone 3 UI
- updating frontend tests to validate mode switching and search/filter interactions
- validating frontend build and targeted backend API smoke tests to confirm branch stability

I intentionally scoped this as frontend template work to avoid merge conflicts while teammates were implementing the timeline and heatmap backend logic.

---

### 3. Features Owned in Project Plan

 - Milestone 3 frontend dashboard shell
 - Private/Public mode behavior scaffold
 - Local search/filter UX foundation

---

### 2. Recap of Weekly Goals

This week focused on fixing the resume ownership bug and implementing the One-Page Resume flow end-to-end for Milestone 3.  
My contributions included:
- separating resume owner identity from Git contributor attribution so the generated resume uses the requesting user's profile details
- wiring the frontend One-Page Resume flow from the dashboard into a working multi-project resume generation workflow
- extending the backend resume PDF endpoint to support multiple selected projects and richer profile metadata
- updating the LaTeX resume template so sections render in the intended order of Education, Projects, then Skills

---

### 6. Additional Context

 - This work crossed both frontend and backend boundaries because the feature needed to be validated as a complete user workflow rather than as isolated changes.
 - Verified the flow with targeted backend tests for config/privacy/projects/resume behavior and frontend smoke coverage for the resume UI path.
 - The final resume template now keeps Education above Projects and Skills below Projects to match the intended layout.

---

### 7. Next Week's Focus

 - Support PR review follow-up and any requested refinements for the resume workflow.
 - Continue Milestone 3 frontend integration work with the rest of the dashboard features.

### 1. Type of Tasks Worked On
![Week 25-26 Task Screenshot](images/week-10-12.png)

---

### 2. Recap of Weekly Goals

These two weeks focused on Milestone 3 polish, LLM integration correctness, and cross-platform deployment improvements.
My contributions included:
- fixing a structural bug where AI-generated resume bullets were never stored and template bullets were unconditionally regenerated on every fetch
- implementing a dedicated resume bullet service (`resume_bullet_service.py`) that generates project-specific bullet points via OpenAI with JSON, markdown-wrapped JSON, and line-by-line fallback parsing
- wiring the bullet service into the artifact pipeline with `_generate_ai_resume_bullets()` and `_clean_summary()`, running after step 9 when `use_llm=True`
- adding a `summary` field to `PortfolioItem` with a template fallback to fix the bug where Description and Summary showed identical text
- centralizing LLM model configuration via a single `OPENAI_MODEL` env var exposed through `openai_client.py` and consumed by all services
- adding cross-platform startup wrapper scripts (`start-miner.sh` / `start-miner.bat`) with exit traps, `--build` enforcement, and a Quick Start section in `README.md`
- implementing Dark Mode across the frontend with a global theme state, CSS variable overrides, and improved theme toggle visibility
- fixing timeline dot alignment and stripping backend `/tmp/unzipped...` path prefixes so only relative paths appear in the UI
- polishing the resume and portfolio generation modals with grouped field sections, two-column layouts, sticky footer CTAs, and inline contact header rendering in the generated PDF

---

### 3. Features Owned in Project Plan

 - AI resume bullet generation and LLM integration correctness
 - Centralized model configuration
 - Cross-platform startup scripts and deployment documentation
 - Frontend Dark Mode and UI polish (timeline, dashboard, modals)

 - Issue #379 - Add cross-platform startup wrapper scripts
 - Issue #386 - Dark Mode and Dashboard/Timeline UI polish
 - Issue #375 - Resume and portfolio modal improvements and contact header fix

---

### 5. Tasks Completed / In Progress in the Last 2 Weeks
| Task ID | Issue Title                                                  | Status     | Notes |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------|
| 406     | Fix resume bullet storage bug + AI resume bullet service     | Completed  | Added resume_bullet_service.py, pipeline integration, summary field, centralized model config, and 38 tests |
| 379     | Cross-platform startup wrapper scripts                       | Completed  | Added start-miner.sh and start-miner.bat with docker --build, exit traps, README Quick Start, and TEST_RESULTS entry |
| 386     | Dark Mode + Dashboard/Timeline UI polish                     | Completed  | Added global theme state, CSS variable overrides, fixed timeline dot alignment, stripped /tmp paths, hid placeholder cards |
| 375     | Resume and portfolio modal improvements                      | Completed  | Reworked modal layout with grouped sections, sticky footer CTA, inline contact header in PDF, and new UI tests |

---

### 6. Additional Context

 - The resume bullet fix required changes across `presentation.py`, `orchestrator.py`, and a new `resume_bullet_service.py`; the LLM integration was previously a no-op due to the storage bug.
 - Model configuration is now a single `.env` change (`OPENAI_MODEL`), verified by re-uploading with `gpt-4o` and confirming the new model was used without code edits.
 - Startup scripts were tested on both macOS and Windows; the `--build` flag ensures fresh backend images on clean clones.
 - Dark Mode and timeline path cleanup were validated with `npm run test` and manual UI walkthroughs.
 - Modal polish tests verified grouped sections, footer CTA visibility, and inline contact rendering in LaTeX output.
