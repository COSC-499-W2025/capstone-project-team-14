### Tasks
![Misha Gavura Week 13 Task Type Screenshot](images/misha_tasks_13.png)

### Weekly Goals

#### What I did
I'm in a progress of implementation of a chronological timeline generator that analyzes project artifacts by modification date and builds a unified skills timeline. The system processes code files, documents, images, and videos, extracting skills and metadata from each. It sorts all artifacts chronologically, tracking when specific skills first appeared and how they evolved over time. The analyzer integrates outputs from multiple specialized analyzers (code, text, image, video) into a single timeline view. Results export to JSON, CSV, and plain text formats, showing skill progression across the entire project history. This enables portfolio creators to demonstrate skill development and project evolution with concrete timestamps.
Output: Chronological skill timeline with timestamps, categories, and detected skills per artifact.

Worked on a presentation and prepared slide for the Git Code Analysis and History

#### Project board
- **Task:** 
External LLM Analysis #33: https://github.com/orgs/COSC-499-W2025/projects/19/views/2?pane=issue&itemId=133282130&issue=COSC-499-W2025%7Ccapstone-project-team-14%7C33

#### Status
In progress, most part is done, doing some testing

#### Impact / Next
- Generate Chronological Project List Issue #35


### Week 14
### December 1 2025 to December 7  

### Tasks
![Misha Gavura Week 14 Task Type Screenshot](images/misha_tasks_14.png)

### Weekly Goals

#### What I did
Continued working on the chronological timeline generator and focused on **fixing and refining the chronological list updates**. I improved how artifacts are sorted and grouped, resolved issues with duplicate entries, and handled edge cases where timestamps or file metadata were inconsistent. The generator now produces a cleaner unified skills timeline that better reflects the real evolution of the project.

I also **worked on the project presentation**, updating and polishing the slides for the Git code analysis and history. I clarified how the analyzer integrates data from multiple artifact types (code, documents, images, videos) and improved the flow of the presentation to match the demo storyline.

Additionally, I **worked on video demo recordings**, capturing walkthroughs of the timeline generator, explaining the main features, and recording demo runs. This included preparing sample outputs (JSON/CSV/text) and drafting a narration script for the final demo video.

#### Project board
- **Task:** Generate Chronological Project List – Issue #35

#### Status
Done. Core functionality is working

#### Impact / Next
Work on the milestone #2.

---

### What I Did

**1. Bug Fixes**
- **SyntaxError in projects router** – Removed orphaned `@router.post("/upload")` and incomplete `def upload_projects(` before `_resolve_representation`, which caused `SyntaxError: '(' was never closed` when Uvicorn started.
- **Portfolio route conflict** – Moved `/portfolio/templates` and `/portfolio/templates/{template_id}` above `/{project_id}` so `/portfolio/templates` is not parsed as `project_id` (which caused `int_parsing` errors).

**2. New Feature: Portfolio Template Query Parameter**
- Added optional `?template=industry` or `?template=academic` to `GET /portfolio/{project_id}`.
- **Industry**: Impact-focused fields (`impact_summary`, `deliverables`, `team_context`, `metrics_formatted`).
- **Academic**: Research-focused fields (`context_summary`, `artifacts`, `documentation`, `test_coverage`, `metrics_formatted`).
- Both templates add structured `sections` for rendering.

**3. New Endpoints**
- `GET /portfolio/templates` – List available templates.
- `GET /portfolio/templates/{template_id}` – Get config for `industry` or `academic`.

**4. Presentations & Testing**
- Watched other teams' presentations
- Gave presentations for the team
- Wrote tests for the filter functionality

---

### Additional Context
- `python -m pytest tests/api/test_projects_endpoints.py::test_projects_list_and_detail_and_portfolio` passes
- Manual verification: `GET /portfolio/85`, `GET /portfolio/85?template=academic`, `GET /portfolio/85?template=industry`, `GET /portfolio/templates` all work correctly
- Task types this sprint: system setup/admin, project planning, design mocks, coding, code review, testing (own + teammate's), documentation, presentations, team meetings, problem-solving
