### Tasks
![](images/abdur-week9.png)

### Weekly Goals

1. **My Features:**
   - Transform the Image Processor into a full **content analysis system** capable of understanding and describing image contents.  
   - Extend functionality to detect and classify faces, text, shapes, patterns, and textures.  
   - Integrate OCR (Tesseract) and shape/edge analysis for enhanced content understanding.  
   - Add classification logic for different image types such as portraits, documents, screenshots, and diagrams.  
   - Ensure all features run locally with no external AI API dependencies.  

2. **Associated Tasks**

     - `detect_edges()`, `detect_shapes()`, `extract_text()`, `detect_faces()`, `analyze_texture()`, `detect_patterns()`, `classify_content_type()`, and `get_key_features()`.  
   - Add new libraries: `opencv-python`, `pytesseract`, `scikit-image`, and `pyzbar`.  
   - Create structured output returning both technical and content-based insights.  
   - Develop and run example scripts to demonstrate single and batch image analysis.

### Reflection Points

**What went well:**
- The image processor was successfully upgraded into a full content understanding module.  
- Integration of face detection, OCR, and texture analysis greatly improved the system’s descriptive power.  
- Local-only implementation avoids reliance on cloud APIs while maintaining strong accuracy and speed.  
- Testing and documentation were thorough, covering all major features and use cases.

- Initial runs were slower before optimization of resizing and color analysis functions.  

### Planning Activities for Next Cycle

**Week 10 Goals:**
- Begin integrating the **Image Processor** output with the unified reporting pipeline.  
- Add visualization and summary metrics to reports (e.g., charts showing detected faces or color profiles).  
- Optimize performance for batch image analysis.  
- Prepare module for final milestone integration and peer testing.
