### Type of Tasks Worked On
![Tahsin Type of Tasks Term 2 Week 6](images/tahsin-t2-week-6.png)

**Coding Tasks:**

*Week 6 - LinkedIn API Endpoints:*
* Created `src/api/routers/linkedin.py` with FastAPI router
* Implemented 2 endpoints: `GET /linkedin/preview/{project_id}` and `POST /linkedin/preview/{project_id}/custom`
* Created Pydantic models for validation with comprehensive error handling


*Week 7 - Intelligent Project Comparison Engine:*
* Created `src/insights/comparison.py` core engine using algorithmic analysis and pattern matching
* Implemented skill evolution tracking, quality progression analysis, testing maturity scoring
* Built growth score calculation (0-100 scale) with multi-factor weighted formula
* Developed job matching algorithm with keyword extraction and relevance scoring
* Created `src/api/routers/comparison.py` with 5 REST endpoints:

  - `POST /compare/projects/{id1}/vs/{id2}` - Head-to-head comparison with winner
  - `POST /compare/match-job` - Match projects to job descriptions (unique feature)
  - `GET /compare/growth` - Growth trajectory data for charts
  - `GET /compare/recommendations` - Strategic portfolio advice

*Week 8 - CLI Incremental Update & Representation View:*
* Updated menu item 2 (`_iact_incremental`) to use `ArtifactPipeline.incremental_update()` properly: lists existing ZIP analyses from the store, prompts the user to pick one as the base, then merges the new ZIP (old-only projects retained, duplicates replaced, new-only added)
* Added `handle_incremental` handler and `incremental` argparse subcommand (`new_zip_path`, `old_zip_hash`) for non-interactive use
* Replaced stub menu item 14 with `_iact_representation`: interactive builder for ranking (criteria, top-N, manual order), chronology toggle, skills (highlight/suppress), and showcase (selected projects); renders a formatted preview reusing `_build_ranking_output`, `_build_skills_output`, `_build_showcase_output` from the API router
* Refactored `src/pipeline/cli.py` to reduce LOC by ~65 lines without losing functionality:
  - Extracted `_split_csv`, `_inp_zip_path`, `_load_project_payload`, `_iact_show` helpers
  - Added `_LIST_ARGS` shared constant to eliminate repeated `argparse.Namespace` construction
  - Collapsed `_iact_delete` branches to a single `handle_delete` call
  - Simplified `_iact_generate`, `_iact_analyze`, `_iact_incremental`, `_iact_list`, `_iact_view_portfolio`, `_iact_view_resume`

### Task from Project Board
* LinkedIn API Endpoints #273 (Week 6)
* Intelligent Project Comparison #278 (Week 7)
* Demo CLI Milestone #2 #294 (Week 8)

### Completed/In-progress Tasks
* LinkedIn API Endpoints #273 (Completed)
* Intelligent Project Comparison #278 (Completed)
* Demo CLI Milestone #2 (Completed)

### Challenges & Solutions
**Week 6**: Implementing secure SQL query builder → Solution: Parameterized queries with proper escaping
**Week 7**: Balancing sophistication with simplicity → Solution: Pattern-based analysis instead of ML models
**Week 8**: Wiring incremental update into interactive CLI without duplicating orchestrator logic → Solution: Delegated entirely to `ArtifactPipeline.incremental_update()` and reused existing API router helpers for representation preview

### What I Learned
* SQL injection protection requires careful parameterization in dynamic query builders
* Code density vs readability tradeoff: heavily refactored code is more compact but harder to maintain
* Job matching provides unique competitive advantage - no other portfolio tools offer this feature
* Algorithmic analysis can deliver AI-like insights without ML overhead or API costs
* Extracting small single-purpose helpers (`_split_csv`, `_inp_zip_path`, `_load_project_payload`) pays off quickly when the same pattern appears more than twice

### Goals for Next Week
* Begin frontend development for Milestone 3 (One-Page Resume and Web Portfolio)
* Implement project comparison visualization with charts
* Create job matching UI component
* Deploy comparison feature for team testing

## Term 2 Week 9
### Date Range
3rd March 2026 - 8th March 2026

### Connection to Previous Week
Building on the CLI and comparison engine work from the previous sprint, this week focused on extending the portfolio API with two new data-rich endpoints: a weekly activity heatmap for visualizing development cadence, and a top-N projects showcase for surfacing the most significant work.

### Type of Tasks Worked On

![Tahsin Type of Tasks Term 2 Week 9](images/tahsin-t2-week-9.png)

**Coding Tasks:**

*Heatmap Endpoint (`feature/heatmap/tj`):*
* Added `GET /portfolio/heatmap` endpoint to `src/api/routers/portfolio.py`
* Implemented `_iso_week_key()` helper to normalize any ISO date or datetime string to its ISO week Monday
* Implemented `_weeks_from_range()` to generate all Monday keys spanning a date range
* Implemented `_heatmap_from_timeline()` to count per-file activity events from chronological skills timeline data (uses actual timestamps when available)
* Implemented `_heatmap_from_range()` as a fallback: distributes total commits evenly across the project's active date range when no per-event timeline exists
* Implemented `_merge_heatmaps()` to aggregate heatmaps across multiple projects into a single dict
* Endpoint returns `weeks` (ISO-date → count, sorted chronologically), `total_weeks`, `total_activity`, and `date_range`; returns 404 when store is empty

*Top Projects Endpoint (`feature/top-3-project-endpoint/tj`):*
* Added `GET /portfolio/top` endpoint to `src/api/routers/portfolio.py`
* Implemented `_score_project()` helper: composite ranking score using `0.5 × commits + 0.4 × √LOC + 0.1 × (code_fraction × 100)`
* Implemented `_build_evolution()` helper: extracts first/last commit dates, duration, total commits, contributors, and activity mix to illustrate project progression
* Endpoint supports `limit` query param (default 3, max 10) and `mode` query param (`public` strips editable customization fields; `private` includes all fields)
* Returns projects in descending score order with sequential ranks starting at 1; returns 404 when store is empty

**Testing Tasks:**

*Heatmap Tests (15 tests — `tests/api/test_heatmap.py`):*
* 11 unit tests for pure helper functions: ISO week key normalization, range generation, timeline counting, range-based distribution, and heatmap merging
* 4 integration tests via HTTP client: response shape, chronological sort order, `total_activity` consistency, and 404 on empty store
* Used dependency injection overrides for isolated database testing

*Top Projects Tests (6 tests — `tests/api/test_top_projects.py`):*
* `test_top_projects_returns_ranked_list_with_evolution`: full response shape including all `evolution` sub-fields
* `test_top_projects_limit_param_respected`: `limit=1` returns exactly one project
* `test_top_projects_public_mode_omits_customization_fields`: public mode strips tagline, key_features, is_collaborative but keeps summary
* `test_top_projects_private_mode_includes_customization_fields`: private mode includes all editable fields
* `test_top_projects_returns_404_when_no_projects`: 404 on empty store
* `test_top_projects_ordered_highest_score_first`: descending score order, sequential ranks
* Seeded deterministic test data with distinct commit counts to make ranking predictable

### Pull Request Reviews
* Reviewing **Generate Resume When Running Upload #315**: [Link](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2025/capstone-project-team-14/pull/315)
* Will review incoming PRs as they are raised this week

### Task from Project Board
* Heatmap API Endpoint #320 
* Top 3 Project Endpoint #319

### Completed/In-progress Tasks
* Heatmap API Endpoint #320 (Completed)
* Top 3 Project Endpoint #319 (Completed)

### Challenges & Solutions
* **Dual data strategy for heatmap**: Projects analyzed before chronological skills tracking was introduced have no per-event timestamps. Solution: implemented a two-tier approach — use actual event timestamps when present, otherwise fall back to evenly distributing total commits across the active date range.
* **Deterministic test ranking**: Without controlled commit counts, ranking order in tests would be non-deterministic. Solution: seeded each synthetic project with distinct `total_commits` values so score ordering is always predictable.

### What I Learned
* A two-tier fallback strategy (precise data → estimated data) is a clean pattern for endpoints that must remain useful even when richer data isn't available
* Composite scoring formulas benefit from a square-root transform on large raw values (like LOC) to prevent a single metric from dominating
* Keeping helper functions pure (no side effects, no I/O) makes them trivially unit-testable without any database or HTTP setup

### Goals for Next Week
* Begin frontend integration for heatmap visualization component
* Connect top projects endpoint to portfolio showcase UI
* Explore chart library options for rendering the weekly activity heatmap

## Term 2 Week 10
### Date Range
9th March 2026 - 15th March 2026

### Connection to Previous Week
Building on last week's heatmap and top projects endpoints, this week focused on surfacing user identity data in the frontend. The backend already stored a `git_identifier` field but had no general profile API, so this week extended the data model and added a full Profile Settings view accessible from the sidebar.

### Type of Tasks Worked On

![Tahsin Type of Tasks Term 2 Week 10](images/tahsin-t2-week-10.png)

**Coding Tasks:**

*Backend — `src/config/config_manager.py`:*
* Added 4 new optional fields to the `UserConfig` dataclass: `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `github_username`
* Added `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` backfill guards in `init_db()` for each new column (same pattern as the existing `git_identifier` migration)
* Extended `update_config()`, `_persist_config()`, and `load_config()` to read and write all new columns

*Backend — `src/api/routers/privacy.py`:*
* Added `ProfileUpdateRequest` Pydantic model with all 5 identity fields optional (for partial updates)
* Added `GET /profile/{user_id}` endpoint returning all identity fields for a user config record
* Added `PATCH /profile/{user_id}` endpoint for partial updates, returning the refreshed record

*Frontend — `frontend/src/renderer/src/api.ts`:*
* Added `UserProfile` and `ProfileUpdateRequest` TypeScript types
* Added `getProfile(userId)` and `updateProfile(userId, data)` API functions

*Frontend — `frontend/src/renderer/src/components/ProfileView.tsx` (new file):*
* Controlled form component with two card sections: **Personal Information** (first name, last name, email) and **Developer Identity** (GitHub username, git identifier)
* Loads current profile from the backend on mount; shows a contextual hint when no user config exists yet
* Saves via `PATCH /profile/default` and fires a success/error toast
* Extracted a reusable `Field` sub-component to eliminate repeated label/input markup
* Used existing CSS utility classes (`input`, `card`, `action-btn`, `pill`) with a new `profile-fields` CSS grid

*Frontend — `frontend/src/renderer/src/App.tsx` and `App.css`:*
* Added `'profile'` to the `AppView` union, `NAV_ITEMS`, `PAGE_META`, and `NavIcon`
* Added `profile-fields` CSS grid with a responsive single-column breakpoint

**Testing Tasks:**

*Backend profile endpoint tests — `tests/api/test_profile_endpoints.py` (6 tests):*
* Used a shared `profile_client` context manager to eliminate repeated tempfile/teardown boilerplate
* Covers: GET returns all fields, GET returns nulls for unset fields, GET 404 for unknown user, PATCH updates fields, PATCH partial update leaves other fields unchanged, PATCH 404 for unknown user
* All 6 tests passing

*Frontend ProfileView tests — `frontend/tests/ProfileView.test.tsx` (5 tests):*
* Covers: initial load populates form, 404 shows not-found message, save success fires toast, save error fires error toast, loading state renders correctly
* All 5 tests passing (19 total across all frontend test files)

* Will review incoming PRs as they are raised this week

### Task from Project Board
* Frontend UI for Profile Customization #342

### Completed/In-progress Tasks
* Frontend UI for Profile Customization #342 (Completed)

### What I Learned
* Extracting a small reusable component (like `Field`) pays off immediately when the same JSX pattern repeats more than twice — it cuts both LOC and the chance of inconsistency between similar fields
* Using a `@contextmanager` in Python tests to wrap setup/teardown removes a lot of structural noise and makes the actual test assertions the clear focus of each function
* Adding columns to an existing SQLite table via `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` with a guard check (`PRAGMA table_info`) is a clean zero-downtime migration pattern that works well for a local embedded database

### Goals for Next Week
* Connect the Profile data to resume and portfolio generation (use `first_name`/`last_name` in generated output)
* Add client-side email format validation to the Profile form
* Begin work on remaining Milestone 3 frontend features
